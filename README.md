# PyLeap-iOS

A Bluetooth Low Energy File Transfer native iOS app written in Swift for Adafruit Industries.

This app will make it accessible to send files via BLE (Bluetooth LE) to your Adafruit hardware on the go!

Work in progress. 


If you'd like to get started with iOS development, I'll written a guide on how you can get started right way.

You can also check out the Basic Chat project this basic iOS project focused on Bluetooth Low Energy communication.
### [Basic Chat](https://github.com/adafruit/Basic-Chat)

Basic Chat is a Bluetooth Low Energy native iOS app using Swift 5. Basic Chat communicates with bluetooth enabled devices that implements the Nordic UART Service.

This sample project is the source for [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/build-a-bluetooth-app-using-swift-5/overview). It is not meant to cover product ready iOS development. It is only an introduction to BLE and iOS.

 • Launch Xcode and run build the project on your target iOS Device.
 
 (Note: Bluetooth Low Engery is not available in the iOS simulator, so the iOS device is a requirement to test the application)
 
 This project is not available to Mac Catalyst yet.
